> [!WARNING]
> ## I don't...
> 
> • want to have a **crush** because it's too hard to do something to the crush you have. If it's easy to do, then YES.
> 
> • want to hear one of the most common hurted words I heard from my friends
>
> • like bully here on social. Be kind and respect. Especially for _ninang_ kaye. 😊
>
> • like to post on Facebook, because Facebook is not safe for content creators.
>
> • like TikTok because TikTok have bad guidelines.

> [!CAUTION]
> I apply the profile picture of Me and **_ninang_ Kaye Collada** is just for inspiration. She has a boyfriend already. So, try not to do bad procedures because me and Kaye are collaborated. Also, we are close friends to each other.
