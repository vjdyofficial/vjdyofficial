This is a patch version of the iconic font, **Maiandra GD**.

This was actually used on our UCCP Church and I'm trying to patch the font to use on different instance.

This patch version includes on the Mainadra GD font itself to combine but has a different styles. Including Regular, Bold and Black with _Italic_.

The font preview didn't work on Microsoft Office Apps but still works on the document.
