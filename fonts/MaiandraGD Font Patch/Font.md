# Maiandra GD patch

This is a patch version of the iconic font, **Maiandra GD**.
This was actually used on our UCCP Church and I'm trying to patch the font to use on different instance.
This patch version includes on the Mainadra GD font itself to combine but has a different styles. Including Regular, Bold and Black with _Italic_.

## Known Issues needs to be attention

> [!WARNING]
> - The font will not work sometimes and the font preview on Microsoft PowerPoint is not showing. Maybe I can change some settings in order to fix this problem.
> - The font on slideshow also works very well on zoom.
> - The bugs can be contained so be sure to send me a issue through this repo.
